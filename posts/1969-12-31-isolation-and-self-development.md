"You must feel pretty lonely sometimes". That's what my therapist said when I told her how I interact with the different people in my life.

If we met, you'd probably think that I was friendly and easy to get along with. You wouldn't think that I would sometimes question whether people really liked me. Or that I didn't believe that people knew the real me. But that's sometimes how I feel.

When I think about my relationships with others, I ask myself what I bring to the table. Why would that person consider me their friend? Am I doing enough? Am *I* enough?

I've come to discover that these feelings are rooted in insecurity with my relationships to other people. Over time, certain factors — some internal and some external — led me feel like I wasn't being a good partner or friend.

Like a chameleon, I survive by blending into my surroundings. In social situations and relationships I emulate behaviours to be accepted by others. Is it so wrong to seek social approval? Of course not. But there are a couple of things wrong with my approach.

1. **My personality never gets time to shine**.
2. **I lose my own sense of self**.

Part of my loneliness stems from how I express my personality to others.

## Social Distancing, or Socially Distant?

It hasn't helped that COVID-19 has shaped the ways in which we communicate and interact with other human beings. The past year and a half has been been strange. It has *felt *strange. Even as an introvert, I find myself desiring more social interaction with others.

Humans are social creatures. We are driven by a desire to connect, to belong. The pandemic put a halt to traditional means of human connection and brought up a paradigm shift, forcing us to find other ways to connect. While the situation feels closer to normal now, I think that the transition period was more difficult on people than we thought. Or at least, than I thought.

I believe that COVID-19 has negatively affected the ways in which we communicate and interact with others. The past year and a half has been been weird. *Felt* weird. Honestly, I believed that everything was okay for most of the pandemic. Being the introvert that I am, I find energy in solitary activities like reading, programming and writing. But as time went on something felt off. I was [languishing](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/19/well/mind/covid-mental-health-languishing.html). How did I get there?

## Self-Development and Isolation

## Tips for Being Less Lonely

### Be genuinely interested in others

> The difference between appreciation and flattery? That is simple. One is sincere and the other insincere. One comes from the heart out; the other from the teeth out. One is unselfish; the other selfish. One is universally admired; the other universally condemned.

### Reach out more frequently to friends and family

We're all busy.

### Be proactive in your appreciation for others

### Go to therapy

### Social connectivity over personal productivity
