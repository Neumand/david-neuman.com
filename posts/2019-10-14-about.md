![](/content/images/2020/01/IMG_1582-1.jpg)I barely have any solo pictures of myself - this screenshot will have to do.
My name is David Neuman, but most people call me Dave.

Here's some quick facts about me:

- I'm Canadian, born and raised in Montreal, QC
- Decided finance wasn't for me after obtaining a Bachelor's of Commerce and passing all three levels of the [CFA program ](https://www.cfainstitute.org/en/about)(yikes!)
- Completed [Lighthouse Labs](https://www.lighthouselabs.ca/)' full stack web development bootcamp in mid-2019
- Wrote frequently for a while at [200 Words a Day](https://200wordsaday.com/@davidneuman), then got inspired to start a blog
- Currently working as a software developer at [Stingray](https://www.stingray.com/)
