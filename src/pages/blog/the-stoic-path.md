Stoicism is an ancient philosophy popularized most recently by Ryan Holiday. I would characterize it as a set of thinking, tools and exercises that allow practitioners to overcome life's challenges. In fact, many Stoic practices involve _embracing_ negativity, so to speak. The idea is that we become more resilient by overcoming negative thoughts, emotions and physical challenges.

I recently listened to a series narrated by professor William B. Irvine on how to apply the wisdom of Stoics to modern day life. Here's what I learned.

## The Power of Negative Visualization

## Picturing Your "Last Time" with an Experience

## Present Nostalgia through Prospective Retrospection
