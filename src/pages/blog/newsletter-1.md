One of my goal's this year is to start writing a newsletter. I'm an avid reader and subscriber to newsletters myself, so it's only natural that I'd want to contribute to the space myself.

Writing a newsletter with a predictable cadence will improve my writing consistency and in turn make me a better writer. And because writing is thinking, it will force me to distill the media that I've consumed over the past week or month in order to share it with my future readers. I'm certain that my motivation to improve my information content diet will increase as well.

So as a bit of an experiment, this post will serve as possible guidepost for the content that my newsletter will contain. It risks being a bit longer than the actual newsletters will be. But the point is to try out different ideas and see what clicks for me (and eventually my readers).

## Blog

So far this year I've written two blog posts:

- [React Server Components: A Primer](/react-server-components/)
- [2020 Annual Retrospective](/2020-annual-retrospective/)

I haven't written enough to know exactly what type of content that I want to focus on for my blog. I think that it's more important for me to "just keep writing. I can figure out the rest as I go. Like I said, consistency is key.

I had a reader email me last year about one of my posts on [joining a startup as a junior developer](/startup-life-as-a-junior-software-developer/). Given my background as a bootcamp grad, I may decide to focus on more of that type of content in the future.

## Working On

- [**Lee Robinson's React 2025**](https://react2025.com/). Sharpening my front-end toolkit while learning from a Vercel contributor.
- [**Building my knowledge base**](https://brain-food.vercel.app/). Launched a personal wiki earlier this year to document my learning.
- [**Personal OKRs**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vAcCLm00ml0e669HpF2EzpezDuDY585krnbAsJ2Ud7s). Started weekly video calls with a friend to keep us focused on our goals with accountability. It's been incredibly useful so far. I'll probably write a separate post about what I've learned from this experience

## Interesting Shares

- [**How to Read More**](https://ryanholiday.net/how-to-read-more/). Some of Ryan's strategies are a little over-the-top, but it seems to work from him. I know I'd benefit from bringing a book to the bathroom instead of watching YouTube. A useful list of tactics for reading more consistently.
- [**The man behind the GameStop Reddit mania**](https://www.wsj.com/articles/keith-gill-drove-the-gamestop-reddit-mania-he-talked-to-the-journal-11611931696). A deep-dive into the seemingly normal life of Keith Gill aka u/Deepfuckingvalue, the man behind the atmospheric rise of GameStop's stock.

## Reading

### [The Art of Gathering — Priya Parker](https://www.amazon.ca/Art-Gathering-How-Meet-Matters/dp/1594634920)

I had heard about this book from several sources. After listening to Priya on The Next Big Idea podcast, I decided to pick it up.

Priya provides a refreshing take on what it means to gather. Why are we gathering in the first place? Who should we invite, and who should we exclude? How can we foster connection among our guests? These questions are especially relevant to me and my fiancee as we plan our wedding.

The ways in which we gather have changed dramatically in the past year. Yet it's interesting — thrilling, even — to read about what social gatherings could feel like post-COVID with thoughtful, generous planning.

### [The Psychology of Money — Morgan Housel](https://www.amazon.ca/Psychology-Money-Timeless-lessons-happiness/dp/0857197681)

I haven't read a finance book since switching from finance to tech. Most finance books are dry and are difficult to get through. Morgan Housel, however, is an incredible writer. I've read many of his posts on [Collaborative Fund's blog](https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/) and he has a knack for transforming complex, often dull finance and economics content into engaging lessons.

Is there anyone that hasn't been following the GameStop saga? If there's one person you want to take actionable, understandable financial advice from, I'd listen to Morgan.

### [Mistborn — Brandon Sanderson](https://www.amazon.ca/Mistborn-Final-Empire-Brandon-Sanderson-ebook/dp/B002GYI9C4/ref=sr_1_1?crid=18IB9NACXJEZ3&dchild=1&keywords=mistborn&qid=1612540622&s=books&sprefix=mistborn%2Cstripbooks%2C169&sr=1-1)

Good old Brando Sando! I decided to start the Mistborn trilogy instead of continuing the Stormlight Archive series. It's shorter and I don't remember enough from the first two books in the Stormlight Archive to continue without rereading them.

If you're a fan of fantasy fiction, Brandon Sanderson is your guy. I also recently finished [The Licanius Trilogy](https://www.amazon.ca/Shadow-What-Lost-Licanius-Trilogy-ebook/dp/B01HMRF5FI/ref=sr_1_2?crid=30A4ZG2B01E9Z&dchild=1&keywords=the+licanius+trilogy&qid=1612540763&sprefix=the+licaniu%2Caps%2C161&sr=8-2) and highly recommend it.

## Listening To

- [**What I've Learned, and What Comes Next**](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0EsqWGFffO6nz20ktTKhYb?si=bhCloAy7QfSqp7sTPlBgew).

## Watching

- [**Your Honor**](https://www.sho.com/your-honor). Fan of Breaking Bad? You need to watch this.
- [**Flack**](https://www.primevideo.com/detail/amzn1.dv.gti.3ebb6b2c-339a-ca66-04a5-ab896860f3f0?ref_=dvm_pds_tit_ca_dc_s_g|m_cMGCyrbmc_c490258183333). Recommended this to my fiancee on a newsletter tip but I ended up watching it as well. It's a show that explores the shocking world of public relations. We've already tore through season one.
