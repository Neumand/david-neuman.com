* **Brainstorming ideas for a fantasy fiction trilogy**. I'm tinkering with a magic system related to [flow](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)>), as well as a world inspired by Greek/Norse mythology and Elden Ring. Maybe one day I'll just start writing!

* Marvelling at the noises that my three-month old son makes. It really sounds like he wants to talk.
