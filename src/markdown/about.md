## 📖 History

I grew up not sure what I wanted to do with my career. Naturally, I went to business school. Most of that time I spent dedicating to my band, [Amongst Heroes](https://open.spotify.com/artist/24gvdVsLGJ4Uwtiq3eSRzi?si=p1NqX9u2RKGF1Took_jO9w). I played lead guitar and wrote much of the instrumentals.

When I got tired of working in finance, I enrolled in [Lighthouse Labs']() web development bootcamp in 2019. It was the best career decision that I've ever made.

I currently live in the Greater Montreal area - where I was born and raised - with my fiancee, our son, and our cat and dog. 👨‍👩‍👦 🐱 🐶
