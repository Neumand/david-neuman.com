Writing helps keep me mindful. Writing makes me a better thinker. Writing helps me remember things that I would otherwise forget. Writing allows me to express myself and share what I've learned with others.

I need to write.

I've been journaling on and off for the last several years. The most important part of an effective journaling practice is to just write. But having a good [system](https://jamesclear.com/goals-systems) can help you build a journaling practice.

## Where to Write?

## Journaling Prompts

I have a list of prompts that I use to help make the journaling process. I do change them up from time to time, but here are the ones that I tend to come back to.

### Grateful For

In this section I'll jot down three things that I'm grateful for. Most of the tine it's *who* but it doesn't always have to be about people. I've written down thanks for material things, my health, pets, events and other random things. The goal here is to write what comes to mind. Some days this is easier than others but that's okay. It's more important to get myself into a positive mindset for the rest of the day.

### Thinking About

I love to write down what I'm thinking about. Typically I'll write down ideas that I have or tasks that I want to get done. For example, I wrote down recently that I was thinking about writing a blog post on my journaling practice.

I also tend to write about good content that I've recently consumed. It helps me to remember it.

### How I'm Feeling

The most important part of my journaling practice is capturing my emotions. I often suppress my emotions, escaping into distractions instead of feeling. By writing down how I'm feeling, it forces me to ask myself hard questions about things that maybe aren't going so well today. Or maybe I'm feeling great and it's an opportunity to set those feelings in stone.

If there's one section that I complete each and every day, this would be the one.

### Today I Learned

### What Would Make Today Great?

### Free Form

Sometimes I just need to *write*. Rather than using a prompt as guidance, I'll just start writing. My thoughts may come out as a little less focused, more scattered. But this type of journaling is powerful because it serves as a sort of stream of consciousness. I think less about

## Where Do I Start?

Just write. Get started. Go get a notebook out of the nearby drawer, pick up your favourite pen or pencil, label today's date and get writing. Or open up a Word document or any text editor and start typing.

You can figure out the logistics later. The best way to start journaling is to start writing. It's that simple. But simple doesn't mean easy.

You might find at first that your words aren't clear. Your thoughts don't make sense. You may start going back over words, trying to reorganize your sentences to better express what you want to say (especially when typing). Fight the urge to correct what you're writing and just focus on getting out what you want to say on paper or the screen. Separate the editing from the creation. In fact, you may not even want to go back and modify what you wrote. There's probably a good reason that it came out the way that it did.
