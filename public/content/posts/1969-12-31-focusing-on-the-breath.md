If there's one practice that helps me most with being present it's focusing on the breath. During meditation, yes. But also randomly throughout the day. When I focus on my breath I put my worries and anxieties aside. Focused breathing tells my body, "Relax, things are going to be okay".

I have a wandering mind. I would wager that you do, too. There's a lot that I try to keep track of: work and career aspirations, personal goals and projects and social relationships, for starters. I've got a few tactics for dealing with overwhelm By focusing on the breath I can think think clearly.

We have too many things to keep track of, too many things going on. Unfinished to-do lists and personal projects. An endless stream of notifications. A distracted mind makes for a restless soul. Ryan Holiday puts it plainly in the title of one of his books: [stillness is the key](https://www.amazon.ca/Stillness-Key-Ryan-Holiday/dp/0525538585).

Thich Nhat Hanh preaches the importance of focusing on the breath. In [You Are Here](https://www.amazon.ca/You-Are-Here-Discovering-Present/dp/1590308387), one of his first teachings is to practice a simple mantra with the breath:

- As you inhale you say, "I know that I am breathing in"
- As you exhale you say, "I know that I am breathing out"

It's that simple. But its power lies in its ability to get you to **focus on your breath**. You become aware of your breath. You are able to distinguish the in-breath from the out-breath.

The other day I took my dog Nora out for a walk. I noticed that I was feeling anxious about my day. My thoughts were clouded, my brain foggy. I didn't necessarily know exactly what was causing me to feel like that, though. So I took a few deep breaths. I brought my attention to the feeling of the breath coming in and out.

Almost immediately, I began to feel less anxious. It almost feels strange to write that I felt more aware of the fact that I was walking outside. The act of focusing on my breathing grounded me. I felt more present and in tune with what I was doing.
