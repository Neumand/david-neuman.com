Inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/now). More information [here](https://nownownow.com/about).

## Personal

In the two weeks I took off prior to starting a new job, I proposed to my now-fiancee in BC :) Some amazing things happening during these otherwise trying times.

## Programming

As a musician I couldn't be happier to start at [Stingray](https://www.stingray.com/), a provider of diverse products and services focused on the music industry.

Happy to be working with React again. Lots of new tools to learn and play around with: Next.js, Redux, and Jest for starters. I enjoyed learning and working with C# and .NET but it'll be nice to get my hands dirty again with Node and full-stack JavaScript.

## Reading

I devoured the first book of James Islington's Licanius Trilogy, *The Shadow of [What Was Lost](https://www.amazon.ca/Shadow-What-Lost-Licanius-Trilogy-ebook/dp/B01HMRF5FI)*, and immediately purchased and started the next one. Highly recommend these if you're a fan of Brandon Sanderson.

## Writing

I haven't been writing much recently; I'd like to change that. The first few posts will be small so that I can get back into it slowly.
