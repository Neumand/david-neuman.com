## The Book in 3️⃣ Sentences

2. Throughout the book, he shares valuable lessons that he has learned: family and friends above all else,  

## Who Should Read It? ❓

Eddie's story is powerful, and I would argue that we would all benefit from experiencing it. More specifically, this book will resonate with those whose grandparents succumbed to similar atrocities. My grandfather was a Holocaust survivor; he lived until the ripe age of 101.

## How the Book Changed Me 🌱

My grandfather spoke little of what he experienced in those concentration camps. What little I knew I learned from my father. One passage from the book was all too familiar to me:

> As the newly arrived prisoners went by, [Dr Josef Mengele] indicated whether they should walk to the left or the right. We didn't know it, but he was conducting one of his infamous 'selections'. Here, prisoners were separated into men and women, and into those who were still strong and would be sent to Auschwitz to be used for slave labour, literally worked to death, and those who would be taken straight to the gas chambers. One side meant beginning a new life in hell on Earth, the other, a horrible death in the dark.

My grandfather experienced a similar situation. At the last moment, his friend told him to sneak into his line. That decision ended up saving his life.

Here are some of the things that stuck with me while reading Eddie's story:

- I came to further appreciate my grandfather's strength. He was a force of nature. But he was also one of the most loyal and generous person that I have ever known.
- I also began to understand why my grandfather could not share his experience with his children and grandchildren. While Eddie eventually had the courage to speak to others and audiences about the Holocaust, he could never look at his children in the eyes and tell them. It would simply be too difficult.
- I began to appreciate more how easy all of us have it today. We'll never truly understand what it was like to live in such horrific conditions under tyrannical political leaders. At least, I certainly hope not.

## 3 Quotes 💬

> This is the most important thing I have ever learned: the greatest thing you will ever do is be loved by another person.

> I never lost sight of what it was to be civilised. I knew that there would be no point surviving if I had to become an evil man to do it. I never hurt another prisoner, I never stole another man's bread, and I did all I could to help my fellow man. You see, your food is not enough. There is no medicine for your morals. If your morals are gone, you go.

> Shared sorrow is half sorrow; shared pleasure is double pleasure.
