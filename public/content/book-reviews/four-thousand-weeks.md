## The Book in 3Ô∏è‚É£ Sentences

1. Four Thousand Weeks is another book about making the best use of your time, but author Oliver Burkeman argues that "time management" has failed and that we should reconsider how we spend our hours with our limited time on Earth.
2. The book explores into a "saner way of relating to time and a toolbox of practical ideas for doing so"

## Who Should Read It? ‚ùì

Those who obsess about being more productive and tackling more in their lives would benefit from Burkeman's take on productivity. It might change the way you look at getting "tasks" done. Instead, you may come away with a greater desire to focus on fewer, more important aspects of your life. The parts of your life that truly matter most to you.

## How the Book Changed Me üå±

The book challenged my view of productivity. *Why* have I chosen to embark on a particular project? Is it something that I've decided to tackle just to say that I've completed it?

## 3 Quotes üí¨

1. The problem isn't exactly that these [productivity] techniques and products don't work. It's that they do work ‚Äî in the sense that you'll get more done, race to more meetings, ferry your kids to more after-school activities, generate more profit for your employer ‚Äî and yet, paradoxically, you only feel busier, more anxious, and somehow emptier as a result.

## Summary & Notes üìù

- We tend to spend more time figuring out how to *be* more productive without experiencing the wonders of our world for what they are.
- Society pressures us to use our limited time in a certain way. A way that is almost guaranteed to cause us stress and anxiety.
- The fundamental problem with our attitude towards "time" is that it causes us to feel that we're never doing well enough.
- **Paradox of Limitation**: the more we try to manage our time with the goal of achieving a feeling of total control, and freedom from the inevitable constraints of being human, the more stressful, empty, and frustrating life gets.
